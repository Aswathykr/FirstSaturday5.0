# First Saturday

First weekend lab. Overall idea is to read the code, read the tests, and then write some code to pass all the tests.

**Be sure to Fork this repo, and `git clone` your own forked copy of this code.**

Be sure to commit all your changes multiple times as you're working on the lab.

`git commit -m "checkpointing my work"` should so. But change the message to meaningful to the work you're saving.

When you are finished, and are passing all the tests, be sure to do a final commit and then do a Pull Request so we can review your work.




now see [README.TXT](README.TXT).
